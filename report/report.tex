\title{Finding the causes of failure: Neuralwave 2024}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

	\begin{abstract}
		We proposed a solution to a causal discovery in a multiple dataset context setting with a prior structural knowledge. Given the different measurements set, we produced an directed graph of causal influences and a ranking of an influencing variables. In addition we implemented a way to precisely constraint our causal model to reflect the changed mode. We developed a complex evaluation metric set for the unsupervised settings. Finally we designed a way to combine different approaches to causal discovery to produce the most reliable approach to generalised causal discovery setting.

	\section{Objective} % The problem being addressed and its significance.
	
	We've been tackling a problem, where we were given several datasets with different latent context, for those we needed to provide the directed acyclic graph, which could be interpreted casually. Namely the datasets were structured as a set of columns, which were grouped in a several blocks, with an assumption of locality between elements of a block. We needed to discover various causal related structures about the given data:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The underlying causal graph
		\item The root causes of the observed change
		\item Visualisation of the graph, the root causes and their influence
	\end{enumerate}


    \section{Approach} % Methodology, algorithms, and frameworks used.

    \subsection{Methodology}

    The process is divided into three stages. First, we do not have access to any ground-truth. In the second stage, we get access to the first 15 rows of the target adjacency-matrix. In the last stage, we get additional access to the lower diagonal adjacency-matrix. We use this ground-truth as prior knowledge in the following algorithms as well as to evaluate our results.

    In every stage, we fit various algorithms to the given data and compared their results. We outline these algorithms in the following sections.

    \subsection{Algorithms}
    
    

    \subsubsection{LiNGAM}
    LiNGAM estimates structural equation models or linear causal Bayesian networks, assuming the data is non-Gaussian.
    First, to apply DirectLiNGAM\cite{lingam}, we merge the datasets while introducing a new feature to differentiate the origins. 
    Secondly, we use MultiGroupDirectLiNGAM: \cite{multilingam} on the separate datasets.
     
    Independent component analysis (ICA-LiNGAM)

    \subsubsection{VARMALINGRAM}

    \subsubsection{PC}
    
    \subsubsection{Structural Agnostic Model (SAM)}
    We use the SAM implementation of the CausalDiscoveryToolbox (CDT). SAM implements an adversarial game in which a separate model generates each variable, given real values from all others. A discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated samples. Finally, a sparsity penalty forces each generator to consider only a small subset of the variables, yielding a sparse causal graph.
    Lastly, the commonly made “causal sufficiency” condition (that there exist no hidden common cause to any pair of observed variables) can also be alleviated.
    each conditional generator (an artificial neural network) “plays” to produce one of the variables Xi given real observations of a (small) subset of all the others, hypothesized to be its direct causes, and noise.
    It is orders of magnitudes slower than Lingam, but also a lot better \cite{SAM}.

    The most challenging issue throughout the process was to evaluate possible solutions without knowing the ground truth.

	The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
	\begin{center}
		\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
	\end{center}
	Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
	use in inline text.  For example,
	\begin{verbatim}
		\citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
	\end{verbatim}
	produces
	\begin{quote}
		Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
	\end{quote}
	
	
	If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
	following before loading the \verb+neurips_2023+ package:
	\begin{verbatim}
		\PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	
	If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
	argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
	\begin{verbatim}
		\usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2023}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	
	As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
	person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
	previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
	(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
	citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.
	
	
	\subsection{Footnotes}
	
	
	Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
	footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
	text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
	Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).
	
	
	Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
	marks.\footnote{As in this example.}
	
	
	\subsection{Figures}
	
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
		\caption{Sample figure caption.}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
	purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
	figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
	the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
	proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.
	
	
	You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
	paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
	color.
	
	
	\subsection{Tables}
	
	
	Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
	strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
	typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
	\begin{center}
		\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
	\end{center}
	This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.
	
	
	\begin{table}
		\caption{Sample table title}
		\label{sample-table}
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{lll}
			\toprule
			\multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
			\cmidrule(r){1-2}
			Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
			\midrule
			Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
			Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
			Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
